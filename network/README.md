This directory is for the implementation of the maru *network* role.

It ensures easy, moderated connection between masters and workers. Networks are often created for specific goals, and are able to select specific job types that masters and workers are allowed to submit and accept via the network, as well as masters that are allowed to publish work via the network.

As masters and workers added to the network are automatically available to all other masters and workers in the network, it is necessary that all members be trusted for the access they are given. However, networks are still practical for both formal and casual situations.
