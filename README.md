# maru

maru (ä¸¸; circle) is a computational task distribution system designed with sharing in mind.

maru masters can employ many workers, and maru workers can subscribe to many masters.
This allows for the creation of large, distributed networks of masters and workers in
which there is no single point of control, and work can be shared freely.

It is intended as a means of distributed computing through collaboration.

## Installation

### Master

    $ git clone https://github.com/devyn/maru.git
    $ cd maru
    $ bundle install 
    $ cp config.ru{.example,}
    $ "$EDITOR" config.ru

Proceed to edit the `config.ru` according to the comments. At the minimum, you should change
the secret and install a filestore. You also likely want to require some plugins.

If `ENV["DATABASE_URL"]` is set before requiring `maru/master`, it will be fed to DataMapper.
You likely want to change this, as sqlite3 (the default) is rather slow.

Likewise, if `ENV["RACK_ENV"]` is set, that environment will be used. You probably only need to
change this if you intend on developing plugins for maru or working on maru itself.

Finally, `Maru::Log.log_level` can be set to one of `"DEBUG"`, `"INFO"`, `"WARN"`, `"ERROR"`,
or `"CRITICAL"`. `"WARN"` is recommended if `"INFO"`, the default, seems too verbose.

The master must be run on an EventMachine-based server. Thin is recommended and included in the
bundle.

    $ bundle exec thin start -p <PORT> # [-d] to daemonize

### Worker

    $ git clone https://github.com/devyn/maru.git
    $ cd maru
    $ bundle install
    $ bundle exec bin/maru-worker --config-example > worker.yaml

Proceed to edit the `worker.yaml` using the following reference:

<dl>
<dt>name</dt>
<dd>
  Required. The name of the worker. Must be unique across all registered masters.
</dd>
<dt>masters</dt>
<dd>
  A list of <code>{url,key}</code> objects. For example:

<pre>
masters:
- url: https://compute.example.com/
  key: t912jpgz9tm40drqqr73lhrh
- url: https://alice.example.org/maru/
  key: ck29my3ivkstit7tno7kzijf
</pre>
</dd>
<dt>plugins</dt>
<dd>
  A list of paths to plugin files to load. It is recommended that these be absolute paths.
</dd>
<dt>wait_time</dt>
<dd>
  Duration in seconds to wait before retrying all known masters if no jobs were found.
  Default: 60.
</dd>
<dt>group_expiry</dt>
<dd>
  Length of time in seconds after the last recorded activity until a group's cached data expires.
  Default: 3600.
</dd>
<dt>log_level</dt>
<dd>
  Sets the minimum log level. Acceptable values: <code>DEBUG</code>, <code>INFO</code>,
  <code>WARN</code>, <code>ERROR</code>, <code>CRITICAL</code>.
  Default: <code>INFO</code>.
</dd>
<dt>temp_dir</dt>
<dd>
  Directory in which to keep temporary files, like the group cache.
  Default: <code>/tmp/maru.&lt;PID&gt;</code>.
</dd>
<dt>keep_temp</dt>
<dd>
  Boolean; whether to keep temporary files after the worker process has exited.
  Default: <code>false</code>.
</dd>
</dl>

You may wish to keep separate configurations for each worker. Note that workers are by design
single-threaded; plugins should ensure they do not do work in parallel. Therefore it is
recommended to start one worker per core.

Assuming you now have a `worker.yaml` ready, simply:

    $ bundle exec bin/maru-worker -c worker.yaml

and watch your newly minted worker run jobs.
